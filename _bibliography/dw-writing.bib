The tutorial uses H5P’s interactive video framework, which presents the learner with activities to complete at key points throughout the module. In addition to helping students understand the difference between primary and secondary sources, “Wheel of Sources” encourages learners to think of “primary” and “secondary” as context-specific characteristics instead of inherent qualities of sources. To help students with key terminology, such as “meta-analysis” and “empirical study,” definitions are included throughout the video. Equipped with this knowledge, learners are then asked to kickstart their own research process by brainstorming possible primary and secondary sources for a research topic of their choice. This module can be embedded in websites and libguides, and integrated into H5P-compatible platforms such as Moodle and Canvas.},

	abstract = {UCLA WI+RE’s (Writing Instruction + Research Education) “Avoiding Plagiarism and Citing Sources” is an interactive workshop designed to help students identify three key steps for avoiding plagiarism: (1) knowing how to cite, (2) knowing when to cite, (3) knowing how to directly quote, paraphrase, and summarize. In addition, the workshop helps learners articulate potential consequences of plagiarism and identify instances of plagiarism. 

The “Beginning Your Research Journey” workshop prepares learners for research by helping them (1) articulate the nature of research, (2) explore activities involved in research, (3) define goals for research, and (4) brainstorm their own research interests. The workshop was created in collaboration with UCLA’s Undergraduate Research Centers and was adapted from their face-to-face workshops. “Beginning Your Research Journey” showcases the diverse researchers and research projects and features real narratives and profiles of student researchers.

The “Finding a Research Mentor or Project” workshop aims to help learners identify potential research mentors and projects related to their research interests. The workshop introduces three strategies for finding a research mentor or project: (1) browsing a university departmental website, (2) asking others about research opportunities, and (3) utilizing UCLA’s Undergraduate Research Portal. Although this workshop covers a few programs that are specific to UCLA, its main focus is on general strategies for finding research opportunities, which can apply to learners at any university.

These online workshops use the H5P course presentation platform, and contain interactive videos, multiple choice questions, and free response activities. These activities allow learners to engage with the content and assess their learning in real time.},

The authors developed these questions with the intent to understand how early-career librarians become acculturated to one-shots, how social identity and positionality shape instructional practices, its impact on burnout, equity, and sustainability, and how the one-shot could be reimagined. This article employs personal critical reflection as a methodology, using interviews with the team of authors and two external participants. Analysis of the interview data showed themes of organizational acculturation with one-shot training, empowerment/disempowerment to employ different instruction models, and the tension between the transactional and relational nature of library instruction. Through these reflections, the article advocates that a relational instruction model helps promote equitable, reflective teaching and learning experiences for librarians and students alike as a way to disrupt the tradition of the one-shot.},
